# Project Name
Express Google Auth Drive

## Description
A full-stack application built with Express that authenticates users via Google OAuth and integrates with Google Drive to fetch and display drive data. This project consists of both backend and frontend folders, where the backend handles authentication and API requests, and the frontend displays the fetched data.

## Features
- Google OAuth for user authentication
- Fetches Google Drive files after authentication
- Organized backend (Express) and frontend (React/HTML) architecture
- Easy integration and extension

## Technologies Used

### Backend (Express)
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **Google OAuth**: Authentication via Google
- **Google Drive API**: Fetch and display files from Google Drive
- **SQLite** (or other DB of choice): Stores session data

### Frontend
- **React** (if used): For frontend UI to display Google Drive files
- **HTML/CSS**: Alternatively, for templating the frontend
- **React Query**: For efficient API requests (if used in React app)
